## Plan of action
[...previous plan of actions](previous_plan_of_actions.md)

## Meow Engine v0.5
- [ ] Creating library for performing basic mathematical operations
- [ ] Adding navigation to github / go back for web builds
- [ ] Reworking camera system and merging rotations with other objects in game using new custom math library
- [ ] Selecting objects
- [ ] Position, Scale, Rotation handles for selected objects
- [ ] File Manager (Reading from file paths and avoiding enums)
- [ ] Creating support for multi-scene compilation
- [ ] Ability to read/write on file for saving import references (instead of hard-coded enums)
- [ ] Implement Tracy throughout engine especially for tracking memory allocations
- [ ] Create Unique ID generator for items
- [ ] Documenting done items and different approaches and used libraries

## Meow Engine v0.6
- [x] Compilation of physx for web
- [x] Single thread app builds for web
- [ ] Updating bash files for supporting physx on mac
- [ ] Support for window
- [ ] Research on making dev/debug builds for in-depth testing
- [ ] Creating vehicle using PhysX
- [ ] Add Unit Testing
- [ ] Creating wrapper for switching between different physics engine
- [ ] If simple, add basic light and sky box
- [ ] Improving current shader pipeline to handle shaders dynamically
- [ ] Researching on auto-build deployment and build status
- [ ] On repo update - auto build emscripten for web and upload
- [ ] Create build modes for debug and release
- [ ] Find a way to isolate and build code while developing simulations
- [ ] 2 builds for web - engine & a multi-scene simulation
- [ ] Create a template for dump-testing shaders
