Coding Conventions:
- Parameter names should start with 'p' followed by CamelCase as "pCamelCase" 
- Classes, Methods & Variable etc... should be in "PascalCase"
- File names should be in "snake_case"
- Folder names should be in "kebab-case"
- use enum class over enum
- only mention override for overridden methods
- Any callbacks methods should start with "On" as "OnThisHappens"
